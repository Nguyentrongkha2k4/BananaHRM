# 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

- **Enhance Transparency & Analytics:**
Provide dashboards and reporting features for administrators and HR managers.

- **Improve Communication:**
Enable in-system notifications and optional email alerts (with n8n integration or message queue).

- **Support Scalability:**
Designed with modular architecture to support microservices, multi-threaded operations, and message queues for heavy load handling.
